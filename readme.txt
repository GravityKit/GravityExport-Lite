== Description ==

>
> [Learn more about GravityExport](https://www.gravitykit.com/extensions/gravityexport/?utm_source=plugin&utm_campaign=gravityexport-lite&utm_content=readme-learn-more)

### Export entries using a secure URL

When you configure a new export, the plugin will generate a secure download URL that you can share with anyone who needs the data (No need to log in!). Reports will automatically update as new entries are added.

#### GravityExport Lite includes many features:

- Limit access to downloads—either make a URL public or require users to be logged-in with correct permissions
- Download reports from multiple forms at once
- Export entry notes along with entries
- Transpose data (instead of one entry per-row, it would be one entry per column)
- Attach entry exports to notifications

If you'd prefer to have your reports generated as CSV, GravityExport Lite makes it easy.

### Add search filters to the URL

Once you have your download URL, you can easily [filter by date range and field value](https://gfexcel.com/docs/filtering/).

#### Credits

- The GravityExport Lite plugin was created by [Doeke Norg](https://doeken.org)

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload `gravityexport-lite` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Go to Forms > Select a form > Settings > Results in Excel to obtain your URL
1. Download that Excel file!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I don't want the metadata like ID, date, and IP in my file =

No problem. You can use the `gfexcel_output_meta_info` or `gfexcel_output_meta_info_{form_id}` hooks to disable
this feature. Or (since version 1.4.0) you can select individual fields you want to exclude on the settings page.

Just add this to your `functions.php`:

`
add_filter( 'gfexcel_output_meta_info', '__return_false' );
`

= I want to rename the labels, but only in Excel, how can I do this? =

Sure, makes sense. You can override the label hooking into
`gfexcel_field_label`, `gfexcel_field_label_{type}`, `gfexcel_field_label_{type}_{form_id}` or
`gfexcel_field_label_{type}_{form_id}_{field_id}`

The field object is provided as parameter, so you can check for type and stuff programmatically.

= How can I change the value of a field in Excel? =

You can override the value by hooking into `gfexcel_field_value`, `gfexcel_field_value_{type}`,
`gfexcel_field_value_{type}_{form_id}` or `gfexcel_field_value_{type}_{form_id}_{field_id}`

The entry array is provided as a parameter, so you can combine fields if you want.

= Can I separate the fields of an address into multiple columns? =

Great question! Yes you can! You can set it on the settings page, or make use of the following hooks to get that working:
`gfexcel_field_separated_{type}_{form_id}_{field_id}` where every variable is optional.

= I have a custom field. Can your plugin handle this? =

Yes it can, in multiple ways:

The default way the plugins renders output is by calling `get_value_export` on the field.
All Gravity Forms fields need that function, so make sure that is implemented.
The result is one column with the output combined to one cell per row.

But you can also make your own field renderer, like this:

1. Make a class that extends `GFExcel\Field\BaseField` (recommended) or extends `GFExcel\Field\AbstractField` or implements `GFExcel\Field\FieldInterface`
1. Return your needed columns and cells by implementing `getColumns` and `getCells`. (See `AddressField` for some inspiration)
1. Add your class via the `gfexcel_transformer_fields` hook as: `type => Fully Qualified Classname`  (e.g., `$fields['awesome-type'] => 'MyTheme\Field\MyAwesomeField'`)

= How can I change the downloaded file name? =

By now you really should know you can change almost every aspect of this plugin. Don't like the name?
Change it using the settings page, or by using the `gfexcel_renderer_filename` or `gfexcel_renderer_filename_{form_id}` hooks.

Also you can update title, subject and description metadata of the document by using
`gfexcel_renderer_title(_{form_id})`, `gfexcel_renderer_subject(_{form_id})` and
`gfexcel_renderer_description(_{form_id})`.

= Can I change the sort order of the rows? =

Sure, why not. By default, we sort on date of entry in ascending order. You can change this, per form,
on the Form settings page (GravityExport Lite) under "General settings".

= I want to download directly from the forms table without the URL! =

You're in luck: for those situations we've added a bulk option on the forms table.
As a bonus, you can select multiple forms, and it will download all results in one file,
on multiple worksheets (!!!)

= How can I disable the hyperlinks on URL-only cells? =
You can disable the hyperlinks by using the `gfexcel_renderer_disable_hyperlinks`-hook.

`
//add this to your functions.php
add_filter('gfexcel_renderer_disable_hyperlinks','__return_true');
`

= My numbers are formatted as a string, how can I change the cell type? =

A number field is formatted as a number, but most fields default to a string.
As of this moment, there are 3 field types. `Boolean`,`String` and `Numeric`. You can set these per field.
`
//add this to your functions.php
use GFExcel\Values\BaseValue;

add_filter('gfexcel_value_type',function($type, $field) {
    if($field->formId == 1 && $field->id == 2) {
        //Possible values are 'bool', 'string' or 'numeric',
        //or, use the constant, preferred:
        return BaseValue::TYPE_NUMERIC; //TYPE_STRING, TYPE_BOOL
    }
}, 10, 2);
`

= I'd like to add a hyperlink to a specific field =
Since most values are Value Objects, we can interact with them, and trigger a `setUrl` function on a value.
`
//add this to your functions.php
add_filter('gfexcel_value_object',function($value, $field) {
    if($field->formId == 1 && $field->id == 2) {
        $value->setUrl('https://wordpress.org');
    }
}, 10, 2);
`

= I've added some notes, where are they? =
By default the notes are disabled for performance. If you'd like to add these to the row you can activate this like so:

`
//add this to your functions.php
add_filter('gfexcel_field_notes_enabled','__return_true');
//or
add_filter('gfexcel_field_notes_enabled_{formid}','__return_true'); // e.g., gfexcel_field_notes_enabled_2
`

= How do I add colors? It's all too boring in Excel. =

Definitely! You get to change: text color, background color, bold and italic. If that is not enough, maybe you should add clip art!

`
//add this to your functions.php
add_filter('gfexcel_value_object', function (BaseValue $value, $field, $is_label) {
    // Need to know if this field is a label?
    if (!$is_label) {
        return $value;
    }

    $value->setColor('#ffffff'); //font color, needs a six character color hexcode. #fff won't cut it here.
    $value->setBold(true); // Bold text
    $value->setItalic(true); // Italic text (to be combined with bold)
    $value->setBackgroundColor('#0085BA'); // background color

    // $field is the GF_Field object, so you can use that too for some checks.
    return $value;
}, 10, 3);
`

= I don't have enough memory! =

Yes, this can happen. Unfortunately, this isn't something that can be fixed without modifying your server configuration.
As a default, WordPress allocates 40 MB of memory. Because the plugin starts the rendering pretty early, it has most of it available.
But every cell to be rendered (even if it's empty) takes up about 1KB of memory. This means that you have (roughly)
`40 MB * 1024 KB = 40,960 Cells`. I say roughly, because we also use some memory for calculations and retrieving the data.
If you're around this cell-count, and the renderer fails; try to upgrade the `WP_MEMORY_LIMIT`. Checkout [WooCommerce's Docs](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/increasing-the-wordpress-memory-limit/) for some tips.

= Can I hide a row, but not remove it? =

You can hide a row by adding a hook. Checkout this example:

`add_filter('gfexcel_renderer_hide_row', function ($hide, $row) {
     foreach ($row as $column) {
         if ($column->getFieldId() === 1 && empty($column->getValue())) {
             return true; // hide rows with an empty field 1
         }
     }
     return $hide; // don't forget me!
 }, 10, 2);`

As a celebration gift I've added some new settings, making the plugin more user-friendly, while maintaining developer-friendliness!

* Enhancement: moved away from deprecated PhpExcel to PhpSpreadsheet (Thanks @ravloony).
